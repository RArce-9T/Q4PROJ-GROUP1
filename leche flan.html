			<h3>Leche Flan</h3>

			<p>Leche Flan is a dessert made with eggs and milk with soft caramel on top. It resembles crème caramel and caramel custard. This delicious dessert is known throughout the world.It has been a regular item in menus of most restaurants because of its taste, ease in preparation and long shelf life. It can also be added as a component to build other tasting desserts.

			<h1>Ingredients</h1>
			<br>
				<p> 
					10 pieces egg
<br>1 can condensed milk (14 oz)
<br>1 cup of fresh milk or evaporated milk
<br>1 cup granulated sugar
<br>1 teaspoon vanilla extract

				</p>
				<br>
			
			<h1>Cooking Instructions</h1>
			<br>
			<p>
					1. Using all the eggs, separate the yolk from the egg white (only egg yolks will be used). <br>
<br>2. Place the egg yolks in a big bowl then beat them using a fork or an egg beater
<br>3. Add condensed milk and mix thoroughly.
<br>4. Pour-in the fresh milk and vanilla and mix well.
<br>5. Put the mold (llanera) on top of the stove and heat using low fire.
<br>6. Put-in the granulated sugar on the mold and mix thoroughly until the solid sugar turns into liquid (caramel) having a light brown color. Note: Sometimes it is hard to find a Llanera (Traditional flan mold) depending on your location. I find it more convenient to use individual Round Pans in making leche flan.
<br>7. Spread the caramel (liquid sugar) evenly on the flat side of the mold.
<br>8. Wait for 5 minutes then pour the egg yolk and milk mixture on the mold.
<br>9. Cover the top of the mold using an Aluminum foil
<br>10. Steam the mold with egg and milk mixture for 30 to 35 minutes.
<br>9. After steaming, let the temperature cool down then refrigerate.
<br>10. Serve for dessert. Share and Enjoy!
